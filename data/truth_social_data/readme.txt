Data files structure
----------------------
Driving this dataset is a network of users connected to their posts ("Truths"). The Truths are then
connected to other entities (hashtags, quotes, replies, media, external_urls) that give more context about the information contained in each Truth.
All files are tab-separated and encoded using UTF-8.

A breakdown of the number of data points for each file:
users.tsv:  454,458
follows.tsv: 4,002,115
truths.tsv: 845,060
quotes.tsv: 10,508
replies.tsv: 506,276
media.tsv: 184,884
hashtags.tsv: 21,599
external_urls.tsv: 173,947
truth_hashtag_edges.tsv: 213,295
truth_media_edges.tsv: 257,500
truth_external_url_edges.tsv: 252,877
truth_user_tag_edges.tsv: 145,234

Terms to Know
--------------------------------------------
Truth - Truth Social's term for a post. Near-equivalent to a Tweet.
ReTruth - Truth Social's equivalent to a retweet. When a user ReTruths a Truth, that original Truth appears on their posts, but the ReTruth cannot be
liked, ReTruthed, or replied to (one can only perform these actions on the original Truth)

Significant information about the Data
--------------------------------------------
Due to Truth Social's query limitations, not all users.tsv and truths.tsv data points were pulled directly from Truth Social.

- For truths: in order to link ReTruthing Truths to their original Truths, during the data-cleaning phase,
    if a Truth is a ReTruth, and its originally referenced Truth did not exist in the data, an entry was created for the original Truth. This entry, however, lacked the Truth's original timestamp.
    To indicate that this information is missing, a timestamp of -1 is listed.
- For users: in order to ensure that all follow edges reference a user entry, during the data-cleaning phase,
    a new user entry was create if:
    1. A newly-created Truth was linked to an author whose user entry did not yet exist;
    2. A follow edge referenced a user whose entry did not yet exist.

    Care was taken to indicate missing information in these entries. Specifically, these user entries contain a -1 in the following fields:
    timestamp, follower_count, following_count, finished_follower_scrape, finished_following_scrape, finished_truth_scrape

- When a user is scraped, the user entry's time_scraped is updated; if that user is seen again in the user queue, it will be scraped again if the time_scraped field is at least 7 days from the current date.
